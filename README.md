# BASIC (version 1.0.alpha.3)
This repo is a boilerplate for new projects.

## DESCRIPTION
This version is dead simple, with no extra packages, and simple navigation (between Start and End pages.)  It does include a "Utils" class just to do some console logging.

There are two markdown files:  
* README.md is for where I left off at, and what to do next.
* NOTES.md is for longer stuff (often mentioned in this README)...

## LEFT OFF
* added intro sound after appReady!
* fixed naming convention issues (like _filename)

## NEXT STEPS
* first app?
* revisit early versions ? (now that main is cleaned up)

## KEYBOARD CONTROL
1 - play bell
2 - play alarm
F - factory reset stored values
S - show stored values
R - test if App ready?
