# BASIC (version 1.0.alpha.3)
This repo is a boilerplate for new projects.

## DESCRIPTION
This version is dead simple, with no extra packages, and simple navigation (between Start and End pages.)  It does include a "Utils" class just to do some console logging.

There are two markdown files:  
* README.md is for where I left off at, and what to do next.
* NOTES.md is for longer stuff (often mentioned in this README)...

## LEFT OFF
* added sound2

## NEXT STEPS
* I found many naming convention issues (like _fileName)
* add another package?
* revisit branches (prune main branch)?
