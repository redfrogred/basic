# BASIC (version 1.0.alpha.2)
This repo is a boilerplate for new projects.

## DESCRIPTION
This version is dead simple, with no extra packages, and simple navigation (between Start and End pages.)  It does include a "Utils" class just to do some console logging.

There are two markdown files:  
* README.md is for where I left off at, and what to do next.
* NOTES.md is for longer stuff (often mentioned in this README)...

## LEFT OFF
* made date2 branch
* made date1 branch, added date class)
* added keyboard input (in Utils)
* added shared package (and Stored class)
* corrected variable names (with underscores)

## NEXT STEPS
* make date3 branch... left off ln: 23 COntroller
* put first_run in stored class...
